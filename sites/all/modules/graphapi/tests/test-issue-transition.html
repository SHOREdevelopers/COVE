            The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/X">X</a> module provides a very similar feature to this module.

            One of the <a href="http://drupal.org/principles">7 principles of the Drupal project</a> is collaboration. Would you consider merging your project into that one and collaborating with its authors?

            Otherwise, it would be great if you could document what makes this module different so that people can make a good decision about which one to use.

            Thanks for taking the time to report this issue.

            However, I am marking this as a duplicate of [#]. You can follow up on that issue to track its status instead. If any information from this issue is missing in the other issue, please make sure you provide it over there.

            If you are new to drupal.org, it would help us if you would search for existing issues before submitting a new one. We strongly advise you search using the drupal.org search facility, because it really is very good. NOT a third party search engine (e.g. Google) as you may well not find what you are looking for.
