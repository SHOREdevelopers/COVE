Ftools is a drupal module to facilitate efficient development workflows with the features (exportable) module.

Specifically, it's add an additional "auto create feature" submit button into the recreate feature form. When triggered, it downloads the feature tar ball, un-tar's it and puts the files in the right place, all in one click. This can save you an incredible amount of time during development.

Please note: 
- ftools only works with the Features 1.x. This is because features 2.x has the same functionality baked in.
- the module requires write access to the sites/all/modules directory. 
- it is intended for personal development, not on production servers.
